This is a hybrid mobile app, made as a school project. The subject is curriculum vitae.

In order to run this file:
1. Download the zip-file.
2. Extract the file.
4. Change directory in your CLI to the master branch.
5. Type the command "ionic serve --lab".
6. Follow instructions and soon your browser will open the application.

The application works best in the Android platform, though other platforms function too.
Google authentication is used in this app so feel free to use it.

NOTE!
In the path CVApp/src/app/ there is a file "firebase.credentials.ts" where you can change the api-key values to your liking. Right now it is connecting to my personal firebase console.
